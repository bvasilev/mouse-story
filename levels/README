This should include all Actors present in the level, such as

  "type" - the type of the Actor. Full list of posibilities below.
  "x" - the x coordinate of the actor
  "y" - the y coordinate of the actor

type is associated with the type which it should follow (with "N/A"
meaning that it follows nothing i.e. stands still).
